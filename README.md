# Disaster Message Classification

Project made as a part of the NLP Course (IT525). The project includes a Multilabel Classifier that classifies tweets, posted during a disaster, in whether the original poster is looking for help or not. Also, if they are looking for help, what type of help are they seeking - food, water, or shelter.  The project also includes a Chrome Extension that gets activated on the Twitter home page and highlights the appropriate tweets.
